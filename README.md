# ParkingSpaceAI: Real-time Parking Space Monitoring System

Welcome to the ParkingSpaceAI repository! This project is a result of our commitment to revolutionizing traditional parking methodologies by employing state-of-the-art technology. ParkingSpaceAI is a real-time parking space monitoring system designed to enhance the overall parking experience by guiding drivers to available spaces efficiently.

## Features

- 🖥️ **Dynamic Display**: Our system utilizes a dynamic display that guides drivers in real-time to available parking spaces, reducing search time and minimizing congestion.

- 🧠 **YOLOv8 Deep Learning Model**: We achieved an impressive 97% accuracy by implementing the YOLOv8 deep learning model. This ensures reliable and precise detection of parking spaces.

- 🐍 **Python-Powered Logic**: Python was chosen as the primary programming language for developing both the AI and computer vision components, ensuring efficiency and reliability in operation.

- 🚀 **Innovative Parking Detection System**: We engineered an intelligent parking detection system that integrates advanced cameras and AI algorithms, bringing a new level of intelligence to parking space management.

- 🚗 **User-Friendly Interface**: The system features a user-friendly interface with a dynamic display, making it easy for drivers to navigate and find available parking spaces effortlessly.

- 🏗️ **Scalable Architecture**: We designed a scalable and flexible architecture that allows for the seamless expansion of the parking detection system. This ensures adaptability to larger parking areas and evolving urban landscapes.
